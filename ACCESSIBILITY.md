# Accessibility Implementation Guide

## Overview

The PataDoc marketing website has been designed and implemented with accessibility as a core principle, following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines to ensure the site is usable by everyone, including users with disabilities.

## Accessibility Features Implemented

### 1. Semantic HTML Structure

- **Proper heading hierarchy**: H1 → H2 → H3 structure maintained throughout
- **Landmark regions**: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>` elements with appropriate roles
- **List structures**: Proper `<ul>`, `<ol>` usage for grouped content
- **Form semantics**: Proper `<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>` associations

### 2. ARIA Labels and Descriptions

- **Interactive elements**: All buttons, links, and form controls have descriptive labels
- **Images**: Comprehensive alt text for all images, including decorative images marked with `aria-hidden="true"`
- **Form validation**: Error messages properly associated with form fields using `aria-describedby`
- **Live regions**: `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates (form submissions, loading states)

### 3. Keyboard Navigation

- **Focus management**: Logical tab order throughout the site
- **Visible focus indicators**: High-contrast focus rings on all interactive elements
- **Skip links**: "Skip to main content" link for keyboard users
- **No keyboard traps**: Users can navigate through all content using only keyboard

### 4. Color and Contrast

- **WCAG AA compliance**: All text meets minimum contrast ratios
  - Normal text: 4.5:1 contrast ratio
  - Large text: 3:1 contrast ratio
- **Color independence**: Information is not conveyed through color alone
- **High contrast mode support**: Enhanced colors for users with high contrast preferences

### 5. Screen Reader Support

- **Screen reader text**: Important context provided via `.sr-only` classes
- **Announcements**: Dynamic content changes announced to screen readers
- **Form feedback**: Success and error states properly communicated
- **Image descriptions**: Detailed alt text for complex images

### 6. Responsive and Mobile Accessibility

- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets on mobile devices
- **Zoom support**: Content remains usable at 200% zoom
- **Orientation support**: Works in both portrait and landscape modes
- **Mobile screen readers**: Optimized for mobile accessibility tools

## Color Contrast Audit Results

Our accessibility audit shows the following contrast ratios:

### ✅ Passing Combinations (WCAG AA)
- **Teal text on white**: 6.23:1
- **Teal text on off-white**: 5.53:1
- **White text on teal**: 6.23:1
- **Charcoal text on white**: 10.98:1
- **Charcoal text on off-white**: 9.76:1
- **White text on charcoal**: 10.98:1

### ⚠️ Limited Use Colors
- **Success green on white**: 2.34:1 (used only for icons and accents)
- **Orange on white**: 2.66:1 (used only for accents, not body text)

## Testing Procedures

### Automated Testing

Run the accessibility audit script:
```bash
npm run test:accessibility
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Tab through all interactive elements
- [ ] Verify focus is visible on all elements
- [ ] Test skip links functionality
- [ ] Ensure no keyboard traps exist

#### Screen Reader Testing
- [ ] Test with NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac)
- [ ] Verify all content is announced properly
- [ ] Check form labels and error messages
- [ ] Test dynamic content announcements

#### Visual Testing
- [ ] Test at 200% zoom level
- [ ] Verify color contrast in different lighting
- [ ] Test with high contrast mode enabled
- [ ] Check focus indicators visibility

#### Mobile Accessibility
- [ ] Test with mobile screen readers
- [ ] Verify touch target sizes
- [ ] Test in both orientations
- [ ] Check zoom functionality

## Browser and Assistive Technology Support

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

### Supported Screen Readers
- NVDA (Windows)

## Implementation Details

### Focus Management

```javascript
// Enhanced focus styles for keyboard users
.keyboard-user *:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #006A80 !important;
  outline-offset: 2px !important;
  border-radius: 4px !important;
}
```

### Screen Reader Announcements

```javascript
// Announce form submission success
announce('Successfully joined the waitlist! You will receive updates when the app launches.', 'assertive');
```

### ARIA Live Regions

```jsx
<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true" className="sr-only">
  {announcements.map(a => <div key={a.id}>{a.message}</div>)}
</div>
```

## Common Accessibility Patterns Used

### Form Accessibility
```jsx
<input
  id="email-hero"
  type="email"
  aria-describedby="email-error-hero email-help-hero"
  aria-invalid={hasError ? 'true' : 'false'}
  required
/>
<p id="email-help-hero" className="sr-only">
  Enter your email address to join the waitlist
</p>
```

### Button States
```jsx
<button
  aria-label={isLoading ? 'Joining waitlist, please wait' : 'Join PataDoc waitlist'}
  disabled={isLoading}
>
  {isLoading ? 'Joining...' : 'Notify Me'}
</button>
```

### Image Accessibility
```jsx
<Image
  src="/images/hero-app-mockup.webp"
  alt="PataDoc mobile app interface displaying a list of verified doctors with their photos, specialties, ratings, and available appointment times."
  role="img"
/>
```
